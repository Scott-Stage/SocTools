Got it — so you basically want a **dynamic component rendering** setup inside your MudBlazor **dashboard with drop zones**, where:

1. The user clicks “Add Device” (or drags one in).
2. That action adds a `SocPcInfoComponent` instance to the layout.
3. The component runs its own internal logic for the specific device it represents.

Here’s how you could approach this:

---

## 1. Make `SocPcInfoComponent` Accept Parameters

That way you can pass the device details when rendering it dynamically.

```razor
@code {
    [Parameter] public string DeviceId { get; set; }
    [Parameter] public DeviceModel Device { get; set; }

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        // Complex logic for this specific device
        // Example: call a service to get extra details
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(DeviceId))
        {
            Device = await DeviceService.GetDeviceAsync(DeviceId);
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 2. Maintain a List of Dashboard Items in the Parent

The dashboard should store a list of items to render.
Each item could have a `ComponentType` and any needed parameters.

```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Rendering

<MudDropContainer Items="@dashboardItems" ItemDropped="@OnItemDropped">
    <ItemTemplate Context="item">
        <DynamicComponent Type="@item.ComponentType" Parameters="@item.Parameters" />
    </ItemTemplate>
</MudDropContainer>

<MudButton OnClick="@AddDeviceWidget">Add Device</MudButton>

@code {
    private List<DashboardItem> dashboardItems = new();

    private void AddDeviceWidget()
    {
        dashboardItems.Add(new DashboardItem
        {
            ComponentType = typeof(SocPcInfoComponent),
            Parameters = new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                { "DeviceId", "sys123456" } // example
            }
        });
    }

    private void OnItemDropped(MudItemDropInfo<DashboardItem> dropInfo)
    {
        // Rearrange dashboardItems based on dropInfo
    }

    public class DashboardItem
    {
        public Type ComponentType { get; set; }
        public Dictionary<string, object> Parameters { get; set; } = new();
    }
}
```

Here, `<DynamicComponent>` is a Blazor built-in that renders components **at runtime** from a `Type`. This allows you to insert any custom component into your MudDrop zones.

## 3. How It Works

* **User clicks "Add Device"** → `AddDeviceWidget()` pushes a new dashboard item with type `SocPcInfoComponent`.
* **Parameters** (like `DeviceId`) get passed into that component.
* **MudDropContainer** shows them in whatever drop zone layout the user arranges.
* You can persist `dashboardItems` in local storage or a DB to remember each user’s layout.

---

## 4. Benefits of This Approach

* Each `SocPcInfoComponent` is self-contained — it can run complex logic for *just that device* without bloating the dashboard code.
* Works with multiple widget types, not just devices (charts, logs, metrics, etc.).
* Easily persists user layout and restores on load.

---

If you want, I can write you a **full working MudDrop dashboard example** with the `SocPcInfoComponent` parameterized and multiple widget types, so the user can truly customize their dashboard layout and it persists. That would make adding device widgets seamless.

Do you want me to put that full example together?
